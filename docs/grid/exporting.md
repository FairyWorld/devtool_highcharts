# Exporting Highcharts Grid

Highcharts Grid Pro supports exporting the grid data to CSV and JSON formats.

## Exporting to CSV

The `Grid.exporting` module provides two methods for exporting the grid data to CSV format:

* `Grid.exporting.downloadCSV()`: Downloads the CSV string as a file.
* `Grid.exporting.getCSV()`: Returns the CSV string.

See the [API reference](https://api.highcharts.com/grid/#classes/Grid_Core_Grid.Grid#exporting) for more information on the `Grid.exporting` options.

## Exporting to JSON

The `Grid.exporting` module also provides a method for exporting the grid data to JSON format:

* `Grid.exporting.getJSON()`: Returns the JSON string.
