# Changelog for Highcharts Dashboards v3.6.0 (2025-09-10)

- Introduced `FilterModifier` to enable `DataTable` row filtering via serializable conditions.

## Bug fixes
- Optimized the Grid Component, so that it does not always re-renders when the table data has changed.
- Fixed styling, added the missing light-mode `--highcharts-neutral-color-10` CSS variable override.
