        This demo showcases Sparkline Renderer feature in a Grid.
        It presents a bunch of different sparkline types, including basic line,
        area, bar, column and pie charts, as well as more customized ones like
        in the last column. In the <strong>Pie</strong> column, the sparkline is
        generated using data from 3 different columns (2 of them are hidden),
        thanks to the `chartOptions` passed as a callback function.
