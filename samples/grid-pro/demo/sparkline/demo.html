        This demo showcases Sparkline Renderer feature in a Grid.
        It presents a bunch of different sparkline types, including basic
        <code>line</code>, <code>area</code>, <code>bar</code>,
        <code>column</code> and <code>pie</code> charts, as well as more
        customized ones like in the last column. In the <strong>Pie</strong>
        column, the sparkline is generated using data from 3 different columns
        (2 of them are hidden), thanks to the <code>chartOptions</code> passed
        as a callback function.
